## Description

Interactive map of New York City featuring data visualizations of crime statistics based on NYC open data.
Map will color code neighborhoods based on : 1. crime rates 2. time of day 3. type of crime

Data is based off of NYC historical crime from beginning of 2018 until end of 2018. Year 2019 has not been released yet.

This project will help users decide if their risk of crime when moving to or visiting a location and answer  
 the age old question, is the neighborhood safe to be in? Example:

1.  Is it safe to walk in a neighborhood at 1am?
2.  Do I want to move to this neighborhood?
3.  Should I get an Uber or walk to the closest subway stop?
4.  Is this neighborhood safe to let my kid's go trick or treating?

Stretch goals

1.  add data on subway train location and train arrivals
2.  mobile alert reminders (if you are out late, reminder that your risk has increased in this neighborhood)
3.  use graphQl to manage datasets
4.  Notorious crime informations
