**View** Once zoomed in enough, visualNYC will transform the user's view into a pin point map with color and radius indicators based on the type of crime and class of crime.

User can click on a pinpoint to see specific crime related details such as severity, location, date and time of crime occurence.

**Play Feature**: By clicking the blue play button next to Time of Day, user can see an automatic progression of crime data over time in both heat map view and pinpoint view.

Data is based off of NYC historical crime from beginning of 2018 until end of 2018.

This project will help users decide if their risk of crime when moving to or visiting a location and answer the age old question, is this area safe to be in?

_Example:_

1.  Is it safe to walk in a neighborhood at 1am?
2.  Do I want to move to this neighborhood?
3.  Should I get an Uber or walk to the closest subway stop?
4.  Is this neighborhood safe to let my kid's go trick or treating?
